Endpoints in API documentation:
alerts: Provides information about any service interruptions or important announcements. This might be useful if you want to factor in how alerts impact bus performance.

facilities: Information about elevators, escalators, and other infrastructure. This might not be directly related to bus performance but could be useful if looking at accessibility or other related metrics.

predictions: Provides predicted arrival/departure times. This is crucial for understanding the real-time performance of buses compared to their scheduled times.

routes: Information about all MBTA routes. This will be a starting point to understand which routes are available and what their characteristics are.

schedules: Provides scheduled arrival/departure times. This is your baseline to compare against real-time performance.

shapes: Gives data about stops and maps for branches, including route variations. Useful for geospatial visualizations.

stops: Information about all the stops. Again, crucial for geospatial visualizations and understanding where delays or other issues might occur.

trips: Data about individual trips on routes. Can help in understanding patterns in bus performance.

vehicles: Provides real-time positions of vehicles. This can give insights into current bus locations, potential delays, and other performance metrics.
